Dear User, 

When you are ready to use the fibers located in app/lib/textual-fibering-methods.rb, simply replace this description in this very file you are now reading, with your data you want to process.

This is a short description of how to use the custom method named, String#to_textual.

The String#to_textual method is in : app/helpers/textual.rb

EXAMPLE :
from this ::  ".. a line /of\ text with $ signs, commas, hyphens;-: and Mr. and Mrs. abbreviations and such as etc."
to this   ::  "a line of text with dollars signs, commas, hyphens, and mister and missus abbreviations and such as etcetera" 

from this ::  "We have sent you our $10,000.00 check to your address at, 123 Alphabet-Only Lane, Apt 3c."
to this   ::  "we have sent you our ten thousand dollars check to your address at, one twenty three alphabet only lane, apartment three c" 

SEE : app/doc/README_for_method-to_textual.txt for live console examples.

METHOD DESCRIPTION : String#to_textual

The String#to_textual method will work on a one word entry, one line of data up to 250 characters long, one document of any length and any number of lines of meaning ending with the period, question mark, exclamation mark, \n, and other ways of determining the end of a line, returning its results with new line breaks as appropriate to the document. And, with the  fibering methods, as shared in app/lib/textual-fibering-methods.rb, we can process one file as input and change the data with the fiber, and put the results into another file.  And, using ARGS, we could process an entire directory of files.  I have not written that method yet.  All methods in texutal-fibering-methods.rb are geared towards getting data ready to enter into our database when our app is fully functioning.  We currently have 50,000,000 processed and ready to enter.
