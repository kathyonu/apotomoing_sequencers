The purpose of this application is to process any textual entry, words, names, phrases, lines in English up to 250 characters, then enter that entry into one database table, and give the entry to another widget for process its five sequences, and entering them into their database table(s).

Apotomoing_sequencers is set up right now as two widgets processing two tables, and .. by its design creates duplicate entries of the data entered into both tables, AND, by putting all five sequences generated from the data entered in the browser into one database table, this will create duplicates in the five columns of the sequence_createds table.

The ideal setup would be to have the five sequences in their own tables, and related all to each other using the modelling relationships.  I have not been able to model that design, so I scaled back to putting all five generated sequences into one table, the sequence_createds.

So, if you enter an Anagram in the browser, the program will eventually process that entry into the anagram table in the anagram:text column, and the sequence_created_id will be assigned, because .. that same textual entry will be entered into the sequence_created.text column in the sequence_createds table, along with the other four sequences generated by their respective methods.

The five core sequences are :

sequence_created
sequence_creation
sequence_complete
sequence_lexigram
sequence_singular
