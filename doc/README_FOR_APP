### Note: At this time, 20110718
#### apotomoing_sequencers now has five sequencers sequencing.

#### This means when you enter your text into the anagram widget,
#### when you tab or click out of the entry box, the five sequences
#### will be generated and entered into the sequence_created widget,
#### without page change, using jQuery, javascript and AJAX.

#### To see the last fully educational development commit, see :
[educational](https://github.com/kathyonu/apotomoing_sequencers/commit/d4b1cbde46fd32c89a02414fee4c59a78b1c1b92 "apotomoing_sequencers, educational")
##### That commit has all learning notes, location notes, generated url notes and such still showing as an older version, not fully working.
##### All future commits will be removing educational materials and displays,
##### leaving only the code required to process the users one data entry into 
##### the five sequences, then entering that processed data into the database.

#### These operating codes are now a reality in this application.

#### On 20110714 we now have the five sequence processors processing.
##### Next steps are, submitting the sequence_created form to the database using ajax, and
##### Secondly, after-success, submit the anagram form.  A two for one submission.

#### On 20110708 we achieved the first success in taking data from anagram widget's form entry,
##### and processing the raw entry with jQuery/javascript, then entering that result into the 
##### sequence_created's widget's form input entry prior to either being submitted.
